            <h1>Cloud computing</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;"><h1>What is cloud computing use for?</h1></div>
        <div style="font-size: 20px;"><p>Cloud computing is a term used to describe the delivery of on-demand computing resources—hardware, storage, databases, networking, and software—to businesses and individuals via a network (usually the internet). Cloud computing enables organizations to access and store information without managing their own physical devices or IT infrastructure. </p>
            <p>As the amount of data being generated and shared continues to increase and consumers demand more access to online services, it has become more difficult for companies to continue operating their businesses on in-house computing servers. </p>
            <p>Similar to the way you check your email inbox online through a web browser, cloud computing enables companies to access and manage resources and applications anywhere there’s an internet connection. Cloud services are also typically managed and maintained by a third-party service provider, allowing IT teams to rapidly adjust compute and storage without having to pay upfront infrastructure costs or set up and manage yet more systems and applications. </p>
            <p>You can choose public, private, or hybrid cloud deployments and the service model based on the level of flexibility, control, and management you need. The three main types of cloud service models include: </p>
            <ul style="display: inline-block; text-align: left; font-size: 20px;">
                <li>infrastructure as a service (IaaS): on-demand access to compute, storage, networking, and virtualization</li>
                <li>platform as a service (PaaS): hardware and software resources needed for cloud application development</li>
                <li>software as a service (SaaS): full-application stack as a cloud service, including the maintenance and management from underlying infrastructure to application software</li>
            </ul>
